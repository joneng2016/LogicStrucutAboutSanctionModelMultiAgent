abstract="Multi-agent systems are viewed as consisting of individual agents whose behaviors are regulated by an organization artefact. This paper presents a simplified version of a programming language that is designed to implement norm-based artefacts. Such artefacts are specified in terms of norms being enforced by monitoring, regimenting and sanctioning mechanisms. The syntax and operational semantics of the programming language are introduced and discussed. A logic is presented that can be used to specify and verify properties of programs developed in this language.",

abstract="Social and organizational aspects of agency have become a major issue in the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) domain. Recent applications of MAS on Web and Ambient Computing enforce the need of using these dimensions in the programming of MAS. The aim is to ensure the governance of such systems while preserving their decentralization and openness. In this talk, we present how multi-agent organisations provide software abstractions, models and tools that contribute to this aim. We focus on the MOISE framework that we have developped during these last years. This framework proposes an organisation programming language for defining multi-agent organisations, that are managed and supported by organisational artifacts at the system programming level and by organisation-awareness mechanisms at the agent programming level. This framework is included in the JaCaMo platform, integration of Jason Agent Programming Language, CarTaGo environment platform and MOISE. We illustrate different features of Organisation Oriented Programming of MAS using different application examples. We will highlight also how it integrates in a broader perspective of multi-agent oriented programming of decentralized and open systems.",

abstract="For agents, one of the advantages of being part of a society is the satisfaction of those goals whose success depends on the abilities of other agents. In turn, societies are controlled by norms and, consequently, agents must be able first to model the society in which they exist, and then to identify the different relationships, due to norms, in which they might be involved in order to act appropriately. Both of these could mean the difference between the success or failure of their goals. To this end, this paper focuses on the identification of the basic components of norm-based systems, and on representing and analysing the dynamic relationships between member agents which result from the processing of norms.",

abstract="The formal logical study of normative concepts and discourse, also called Deontic Logic, was inaugurated in the early 1950's. Before deontic logic was born, its very possibility was often doubted --- for philosophical rather than formal logical reasons. It can hardly be denied that, at least as a formal discipline, deontic logic has turned out to be both possible and interesting. But it must be admitted that the new discipline nevertheless continues to be problematic. One of the open questions about it is whether it has any fruitful applications to ethics or to legal theory or to the social scientists' study of norms. Some regard deontic logic as being full of promise in these regards. But the hopes have not so far been to any great extent fulfilled --- and this has made others doubt whether they have not been exaggerated, to say the least.",

abstract="A Multiagent System (MAS) that explicitly represents its organization normally focuses either on the functioning or the structure of this organization. However, addressing both aspects is a prolific approach when one wants to design or describe a MAS organization. The problem is to define these aspects in such a way that they can be both assembled in a single coherent specification. The ℳOISE+ model --- described here through a soccer team example --- intends to be a step in this direction since the organization is seen under three points of view: structural, functional, and deontic.",
