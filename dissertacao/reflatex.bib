  abstract="Multi-agent systems are viewed as consisting of individual agents whose behaviors are regulated by an organization artefact. This paper presents a simplified version of a programming language that is designed to implement norm-based artefacts. Such artefacts are specified in terms of norms being enforced by monitoring, regimenting and sanctioning mechanisms. The syntax and operational semantics of the programming language are introduced and discussed. A logic is presented that can be used to specify and verify properties of programs developed in this language.",

  abstract="Social and organizational aspects of agency have become a major issue in the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) domain. Recent applications of MAS on Web and Ambient Computing enforce the need of using these dimensions in the programming of MAS. The aim is to ensure the governance of such systems while preserving their decentralization and openness. In this talk, we present how multi-agent organisations provide software abstractions, models and tools that contribute to this aim. We focus on the MOISE framework that we have developped during these last years. This framework proposes an organisation programming language for defining multi-agent organisations, that are managed and supported by organisational artifacts at the system programming level and by organisation-awareness mechanisms at the agent programming level. This framework is included in the JaCaMo platform, integration of Jason Agent Programming Language, CarTaGo environment platform and MOISE. We illustrate different features of Organisation Oriented Programming of MAS using different application examples. We will highlight also how it integrates in a broader perspective of multi-agent oriented programming of decentralized and open systems.",

In turn, societies are controlled by norms and, consequently, agents must be able first to model the society in which they exist, and then to identify the different relationships, due to norms, in which they might be involved in order to act appropriately. Both of these could mean the difference between the success or failure of their goals. To this end, this paper focuses on the identification of the basic components of norm-based systems, and on representing and analysing the dynamic relationships between member agents which result from the processing of norms.",

  abstract="The formal logical study of normative concepts and discourse, also called Deontic Logic, was inaugurated in the early 1950's. Before deontic logic was born, its very possibility was often doubted --- for philosophical rather than formal logical reasons. It can hardly be denied that, at least as a formal discipline, deontic logic has turned out to be both possible and interesting. But it must be admitted that the new discipline nevertheless continues to be problematic. One of the open questions about it is whether it has any fruitful applications to ethics or to legal theory or to the social scientists' study of norms. Some regard deontic logic as being full of promise in these regards. But the hopes have not so far been to any great extent fulfilled --- and this has made others doubt whether they have not been exaggerated, to say the least.",

The negotiation process needs to take into account the safety rules and the relevant elements of their application contexts. We propose to use a virtual environment to stimulate this process. The success of such negotiations (in virtual environments) depends on the identification of required knowledge for representing safety rules application contexts. In this paper we present our model and methodology MELISSA that aim at identifying this knowledge, and to share it within the virtual environment design team. We first describe the knowledge needed to represent a working situation. Then, we present elements required for the conception of such virtual environments.

  abstract = "In the new AI of the 90s an important stream is artificial social intelligence. In this work basic ontological categories for social action, structure, and mind are introduced. Sociality (social action, social structure) is let emerge from the action and intelligence of individual agents in a common world. Also some aspects of the way-down—how emergent collective phenomena shape the individual mind—are examined. First, interference and dependence are defined, and then different kinds of coordination (reactive versus anticipatory; unilateral versus bilateral; selfish versus collaborative) are characterised. “Weak social action”, based on beliefs about the mind of the other agents, and “strong social action”, based on goals about others' minds and their actions, are distinguished. Special attention is paid to Goal Delegation and Goal Adoption that are considered as the basic ingredients of social commitment and contract, and then of exchange, cooperation, group action, and organisation. Different levels of delegation and then of autonomy of the delegated agent are described; and different levels of goal-adoption are shown to characterise true collaboration. Social goals in the minds of the group members are argued to be the real glue of joint activity, and the notion of social commitment, as different from individual and from collective commitment, is underlined. The necessity for modelling social objective structures and constraints is emphasised and the “shared mind” view of groups and organisations is criticised. The spontaneous and unaware emergence of a dependence structure is explained, as well as its feedback on the participants' minds and behaviours. Critical observations are presented on current confusions such as that between “social” and “collective” action, or between communication and social action. The main claims of the paper are the following: (a) The real foundation of all sociality (cooperation, competition, groups, organisation, etc.) is the individual social action and mind. One cannot reduce or connect action at the collective level to action at the individual level unless one passes through the social character of the individual action, (b) Important levels of coordination and cooperation necessarily require minds and cognitive agents (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.). (c) However, cognition, communication and agreement are not enough for modelling and implementing cooperation: emergent pre-cognitive structures and constraints should be formalised, and emergent forms of cooperation are needed also among planning and deliberative agents, (d) We are going towards a synthetic paradigm in AI and Cognitive Science, reconciling situatedness and plans, reactivity and mental representations, cognition, emergence and self-organisation."

CArtAgO enables MAS engineers to design and develop suitable artifacts, and to extend existing agent platforms with the possibility to create artifact-based working environments, programming agents to exploit them.

Artifacts are runtime devices providing some kind of function or service which agents can fruitfully use -- both individually and collectively -- to achieve their individual as well as social objectives. Artifacts can be conceived (and programmed) as basic building blocks to model and build agent (working) environments. Besides introducing a conceptual and modelling framework, the paper discusses the impact of this new notion on MAS programming, focussing in particular on MAS composed by cognitive agents. To make the discussion more concrete, we provide an example scenario featuring 3APL agents whose coordination activity is supported by TuCSoN tuple centres -- an existing coordination model providing some of the basic properties of artifacts for MASs.",

  abstract = "In spite of all efforts to design safer systems, we still witness severe, large-scale accidents. A basic question is: Do we actually have adequate models of accident causation in the present dynamic society? The socio-technical system involved in risk management includes several levels ranging from legislators, over managers and work planners, to system operators. This system is presently stressed by a fast pace of technological change, by an increasingly aggressive, competitive environment, and by changing regulatory practices and public pressure. Traditionally, each level of this is studied separately by a particular academic discipline, and modelling is done by generalising across systems and their particular hazard sources. It is argued that risk management must be modelled by cross-disciplinary studies, considering risk management to be a control problem and serving to represent the control structure involving all levels of society for each particular hazard category. Furthermore, it is argued that this requires a system-oriented approach based on functional abstraction rather than structural decomposition. Therefore, task analysis focused on action sequences and occasional deviation in terms of human errors should be replaced by a model of behaviour shaping mechanisms in terms of work system constraints, boundaries of acceptable performance, and subjective criteria guiding adaptation to change. It is found that at present a convergence of research paradigms of human sciences guided by cognitive science concepts supports this approach. A review of this convergence within decision theory and management research is presented in comparison with the evolution of paradigms within safety research."

  abstract = "Analysis of industrial situations on a day-to-day basis shows deviations between that which is foreseen (at the design stage), that which is integrated into and installed on the production site, and that which takes place during operation. These deviations reflected the differences between the task and the activity, which is standard and known in ergonomics, but also between the planned nominal technical operation and the real operation including different situation recovery events, faults and failures (technical, human, organisational, etc.). The result of this real operation then may seriously affect production performance. However, it has been observed that this performance is preserved to a greater or lesser extent by the adaptive and palliative interventions of the operators. In specific cases, these interventions appear as “boundary activities” from the point of view of both the system performance and safety, but are nevertheless tolerated during use. We therefore attempted to understand the origin and characteristics of these activities, as well as their benefits and associated risks in a context marked by different forms of tolerance. Two categories of boundary activities were identified involving actors from different hierarchical levels and decision units, and production operators. Their detailed analysis involves the identification of a set of “boundary conditions tolerated by use”. As described by Rasmussen [Safety Science, 27(2–3), (1997) 183], these boundary conditions tolerated by use mark a migration of the system towards less safe levels, reduce the room for manoeuvre of the operators, and engender risks for the socio-technical system. Knowledge of these conditions and their classification in relation to the boundary conditions tolerated by use stemming from the design and the internal boundary conditions tolerated by use of the firm should enable us to let these be taken into account by the designer so that they can be integrated, removed and/or accompanied by specific measures. Thus, consideration of boundary activities and boundary conditions tolerated by use during the design could allow the reference framework of the operational to be brought up to date. In addition, to be efficient, a prevention policy in a given company can benefit from the analysis of these phenomenons."

  abstract = "The theory of possibility described in this paper is related to the theory of fuzzy sets by defining the concept of a possibility distribution as a fuzzy restriction which acts as an elastic constraint on the values that may be assigned to a variable. More specifically, if F is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse U={u} which is characterized by its membership function μF, then a proposition of the form “X is F,” where X is a variable taking values in U, induces a possibility distribution ∏X which equates the possibility of X taking the value u to μF(u)—the compatibility of u with F. In this way, X becomes a fuzzy variable which is associated with the possibility distribution ∏x in much the same way as a random variable is associated with a probability distribution. In general, a variable may be associated both with a possibility distribution and a probability distribution, with the weak connection between the two expressed as the possibility/probability consistency principle. A thesis advanced in this paper is that the imprecision that is intrinsic in natural languages is, in the main, possibilistic rather than probabilistic in nature. Thus, by employing the concept of a possibility distribution, a proposition, p, in a natural language may be translated into a procedure which computes the probability distribution of a set of attributes which are implied by p. Several types of conditional translation rules are discussed and, in particular, a translation rule for propositions of the form “X is F is α-possible,” where α is a number in the interval [0, 1], is formulated and illustrated by examples."
